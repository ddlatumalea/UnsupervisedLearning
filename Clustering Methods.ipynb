    "- class: KMeans\n",
    "- distance: euclidean\n",
    "- Use case: find a few clusters of ~ same size\n",
    "- Remark:\n",
    "    - fast\n",
    "    - metric used is Euclidean distance, and variance is a measure of cluster scatter. If clusters have different variances, K-means can fail to cluster them. It expects to be spherical-shaped.\n",
    "    - Diagnostic tests to determine $k$.\n",
    "    - converges to a local minimum, therefore run it multiple times `n_iter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean shift**:\n",
    "- class: MeanShift\n",
    "- Distance: euclidean\n",
    "- Use case: determine the (large) amount of clusters\n",
    "- Remark: slow, bad on weird shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Divisive approach**: top-down, data points are clustered together into one cluster. In iterations, a cluster is split into smaller clusters.\n",
    "- class: ?\n",
    "- distance: ?\n",
    "- use case: ?\n",
    "- remark: ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**HAC**: bottom-up. Each data forms a separate cluster. Distances between all clusters are computed. Closest clusters are merged. Repeated until convergence.\n",
    "- Linkage criterion: defining the distance between a point and a cluster or between clusters:\n",
    "    - Complete linkage: distance set to maximum distance between elements of each cluster.\n",
    "    - Single linnkage: distance set to minimum distance between elements of each cluster.\n",
    "    - Ward's method (Ward's minimum variance method): minimize the total within-cluster variance.\n",
    "- Determining clusters:\n",
    "    - Distance threshold.\n",
    "    - Specifying n_clusters\n",
    "- class: AgglomerativeClustering\n",
    "- distance: L1/L2/cosine/Jaccard/Hamming/precomputed, any pairwise method.\n",
    "- Use case: get a full tree (informative)\n",
    "- remark: slow, good on weird shapes or uneven cluster sizes. Visualized in dendrogram. Performance depends on distance metric.\n",

    "**DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise)**:\n",
    "- class: DBSCAN\n",
    "- Distance: any\n",
    "- use case: tons of data and weird shapes\n",
    "- remark: highly configurable with good performance. Uses density. Cannot cluster well when there are large differences in densities. OPTICS algorithm may work.\n",

    "**Birch**:\n",

    "**Affinity propagation**:\n",
    "- class: ?\n",
    "- Distance: ?\n",
    "- use case: voting system, where instances vote for similar instances. Detect any number of clusters of different sizes.\n",

    "**Spectral clustering**:\n",
    "- class: ?\n",
    "- Distance: similarity matrix\n",
    "- use case: Used when there are few clusters and sizes are ~ even.\n",
    "- remarks: does not scale well, bad on different sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Mixture Model**:\n",
    "- class: GaussianMixture\n",
    "- Distance: ?\n",
    "- use case: Gaussian distribution, good on ellipsoidal shapes. Outlier detection.\n",
    "- Remarks: doesn't scale well. Tries to fit all the data.\n",
